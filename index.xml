Mostly a mix of questionnaires, open source investigations, sometimes onsite assessments. This is not efficient in today&amp;rsquo;s world as poor vendors are forced to spend 100s of hours each year filling in questionniares with same or similar questions over and over again. It’s not efficient for every outfit to ask their own Qs that are very similar. But CISOs are reluctant to trust BitSight/RiskLedger/other 3rd party compliance snapshots.</description></item><item><title>Threat Model (over breakfast)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/training/training-breakfast-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/training/training-breakfast-threat-modeling/</guid><description>Why In order to participate in the discussions a basic understanding of threat modeling is needed.
