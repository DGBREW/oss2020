This also involves attribution of $ value to risk and how security teams can talk the language of the business

Current practice tends to hide uncertainty and present certainty.</description></item><item><title>How does a CISO add value to a business?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso/ciso-add-value-to-a-business/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/tracks/ciso/ciso-add-value-to-a-business/</guid><description> Topics to cover: Can we add value to the business through more closely aligned strategies?

Mostly a mix of questionnaires, open source investigations, sometimes onsite assessments. This is not efficient in today&amp;rsquo;s world as poor vendors are forced to spend 100s of hours each year filling in questionniares with same or similar questions over and over again. Itâ€™s not efficient for every outfit to ask their own Qs that are very similar. But CISOs are reluctant to trust BitSight/RiskLedger/other 3rd party compliance snapshots.</description></item></channel></rss>
